          About Recovery on the Harbor
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
          Recovery on the Harbor is a peer recovery support center serving the East Boston/Chelsea area in Massachusetts. Our mission is to foster a welcoming, non‐judgmental community where individuals in all stages of recovery can find peer‐led support, educational resources, and social connection. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to build a meaningful, substance‐free life—regardless of past challenges or current struggles.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
          Our center is funded by grants and donations, which allows us to keep all of our membership and services completely free. We host weekly peer support meetings, life skills workshops, educational seminars, and recreational events so that our members can connect with others who understand the recovery journey. Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been in recovery for years, you’ll find compassion, respect, and genuine community at Recovery on the Harbor.
